# DrugNet: Faster Drug Discovery Using Generative Deep Learning

# Developed an AI system that generates drug-like molecules to inhibit a target protein using an autoencoder model to create a
continuous chemical space, a 1D-CNN for measuring the inhibition score, and a swarm-based optimization algorithm for optimizing molecules. Performed 10.6% better than state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets.
